AP CSP 2024 FRQ Answer Guide (Practice)

Q1 (6 points): Data & Digital Information
- Describes using a list/table to store step counts per day or per user.
- Explains data abstraction as hiding implementation details while exposing useful operations.
- Provides a correct weekly summary example (total steps, average steps, or trend).
- Mentions iteration over the data to compute summary values.
- Mentions how abstraction supports reuse or scalability.
- Includes clear, accurate explanation.

Q2 (6 points): Algorithms and Programming
- Initializes a maximum variable to the first element.
- Iterates through each element in the list.
- Updates the maximum when a larger value is found.
- Outputs or returns the maximum at the end.
- States time complexity O(n).
- Uses clear, high-level pseudocode description.

Q3 (6 points): Internet and Networks
- Identifies two valid issues (latency, bandwidth limits, packet loss, jitter, congestion).
- Explains how each issue affects video calls.
- Provides a mitigation for each (lower bitrate, wired connection, QoS, retries, different network).
- Uses accurate networking terminology.
- Responses are specific to the scenario.
- Includes clear cause-and-mitigation pairing.

Q4 (6 points): Impact of Computing
- Identifies a benefit (efficiency, deterrence, consistency, scale).
- Identifies a risk (false positives, bias, privacy, lack of transparency).
- Explains why the risk matters.
- Suggests a mitigation (human review, transparency, appeals process, audits).
- Notes ethical or social impact.
- Response is clear and actionable.
