AP CSP 2024 Practice FRQs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1. Data & Digital Information
Prompt: A student is building an app that collects step counts from users.
Explain how data abstraction can be used to store and process the step data.
Provide an example of how the app could summarize the data for a weekly report.

Suggested response should include:
- A data structure (list/array/table) that stores step counts
- Abstraction allows managing complexity by hiding low-level details
- Example summary such as average, total, or trend
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q2. Algorithms and Programming
Prompt: A program scans a list of temperatures and outputs the highest value.
Write a high-level algorithm in pseudocode and describe its time complexity.

Suggested response should include:
- Initialize max to first value
- Loop through list and update max when larger value found
- Complexity O(n)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q3. Internet and Networks
Prompt: A video call stutters during a class session.
Explain two possible network issues that could cause this and one mitigation for each.

Suggested response should include:
- Latency, packet loss, bandwidth limits, congestion
- Mitigations: wired connection, lower resolution, QoS, retry/ACK
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q4. Impact of Computing
Prompt: A school uses AI to detect plagiarism.
Describe one benefit and one risk of this system.
Explain how the school could address the risk.

Suggested response should include:
- Benefit: efficiency, consistency, deterrence
- Risk: false positives, bias, privacy
- Mitigation: human review, transparency, opt-out, audits
